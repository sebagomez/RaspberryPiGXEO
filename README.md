# RaspberryPiGXEO
Raspberry Pi 2 GeneXus External Object was used during a demo at the [25th GeneXus Meeting](http://www.genexus.com/gx25) in Montevideo, Uruguay on Sep 2015.

It's main purpose was to show how a Genexus generated Universal app could run in the Raspberry Pi. The external object itself has two method for tuning on and off a desired pin of the board and a method for SPIO reading.

We used that on a live demo where we used a light sensor and hokked everything to [thingspeak.com](http://www.thingspeak.com).

The code used here was based on the many samples from [github.com/ms-iot/samples](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples)
